Hello! üëã I'm Kyungchan aka Chris, Undergraduate Student at Grand Canyon University majoring in Computer Science with an Emphasis on Big Data Analytics. 
Fascinated by the insights derived from data, I am extremely interested in large language models (LLM), 
Data Science, Data Engineering. I guess anything about data! and their applications in making data-driven decisions. 
With a focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI, my goal is to contribute to 
organizations by leveraging these technologies to solve complex problems.
